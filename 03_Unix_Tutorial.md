## Shortcuts

* "control+c" will cancel the command you are writing, and give you a fresh prompt.
* "control+a" will bring you to the start of the command you are writing.
* "control+e" will bring you to the end of the command


## Filesystems

To see where you are: 

	pwd
	
To go up a level: 

	cd ..
	
To stay in the same directory: 

	cd .
	
To go to the home directory: 

	cd ~

To make a new directory:

	mkdir path-to-directory
	
To copy a directory with all of its contents:

	cp -r path-to-directory path-to-new-location
	
To move to a directory:

	cd path-to-directory
	
To see what is in the directory in a nice format:

	ls -lthFr


## Less

* "spacebar" : to go forward
* "b" : to go backward
* "g" : to go to the beginning
* "G" : to go to the end
* "q" : to quit
* "/" : to search

## Head

To view a specific number of lines use option `-n`: 

	head -n 1 file-name

## Alias

To make an alias for a command add the following line to ~/.bashrc:

	alias new_command_name='list_of_commands'

Then do: 

	source ~/.bashrc

## Exercises
	
### Exercise 1

Set up your `ngs_course` directory: 

	cd ~
	mkdir ngs_course
	cp -r /groups/hbctraining/ngs-data-analysisSummer2016/unix_lesson/ ngs_course


List the `Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq` files from your home directory. (Hint: The file is located in ngs_course > unix_lesson > raw_fastq)

	ls -lthFr ngs_course_rep/unix_lesson/raw_fastq/Mov10*1*
	
### Exercise 2

Change directories to `/home/username/ngs_course/unix_lesson/raw_fastq/`, and list the contents of `unix_lesson/genomics_data` without changing directories again.
	
	ls -lthFr ../genomics_data/
	
List the contents of the `/bin` directory. Do you see anything familiar in there? How can you tell these are programs rather than plain files?

	ls -lthFr /bin

*The `-F` option for command `ls` adds a special character to specify filetype. Command names are followed by an `*`*
	
### Exercise 3
Do each of the following using a single `ls` command without navigating to a different directory.

1. List all of the files in `/bin` that start with the letter 'c'

		ls -lthFr /bin/c*

2. List all of the files in `/bin` that contain the letter 'a'

		ls -lthFr /bin/*a*

3. List all of the files in `/bin` that end with the letter 'o'

		ls -lthFr /bin/*o
		
4. List all of the files in `/bin` that contain the letter 'a' or 'c'.

		ls -lthFr /bin/*a* /bin/*c*

### Exercise 4

Find the line number in your history for the last exercise (listing files in `/bin`) and reissue that command.		

	history
	!1021

### Exercise 5

1. Create a new directory called `backup_ref_data` in `~/ngs_course/unix_lesson/` 

		mkdir ~/ngs_course_rep/unix_lesson/backup_ref_data

2. Copy over the contents of the `~/ngs_course/unix_lesson/reference_data/` into `backup_ref_data` after changing directories to `~/ngs_course/unix_lesson/` (if you are not already there).

		cp ~/ngs_course_rep/unix_lesson/reference_data/* ~/ngs_course_rep/unix_lesson/backup_ref_data/

3. Using just one command, move the `raw_fastq/backup/` directory to your current working directory (which is `~/ngs_course/unix_lesson/`) and rename it `backup_fastq`.

		mkdir ~/ngs_course_rep/unix_lesson/raw_fastq/backup
		mv ~/ngs_course_rep/unix_lesson/raw_fastq/Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq backup/Mov10_oe_1.subset-copy.fq
		mv ~/ngs_course_rep/unix_lesson/raw_fastq/backup/ ~/ngs_course_rep/unix_lesson/backup_fastq/

4. Remove backup directories carefully

		rm -ri backup_ref_data/ backup_fastq/
